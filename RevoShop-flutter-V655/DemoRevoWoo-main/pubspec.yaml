# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

flutter:
  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/
    - images/lobby/
    - images/account/
    - images/blog/
    - images/cart/
    - images/order/
    - images/product_detail/
    - images/search/
    - i18n/en.json
    - i18n/id.json
    - i18n/es.json
    - i18n/fr.json
    - i18n/zh.json
    - i18n/ja.json
    - i18n/ko.json
    - i18n/ar.json
    - i18n/nl.json
    - i18n/pt.json

    - i18n/iw.json
    - i18n/hi.json
    - i18n/te.json
    - i18n/ms.json

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Poppins-ExtraLight.ttf
          weight: 100
        - asset: fonts/Poppins-Thin.ttf
          weight: 200
        - asset: fonts/Poppins-Light.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: fonts/Poppins-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: fonts/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: fonts/Poppins-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: fonts/Poppins-Black.ttf
          weight: 800
        - asset: fonts/Poppins-ExtraBold.ttf
          weight: 900
    - family: OpenSans
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/OpenSans-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/OpenSans-Italic.ttf
          style: italic
        - asset: fonts/OpenSans-Medium.ttf
          weight: 200
        - asset: fonts/OpenSans-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: fonts/OpenSans-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
